        <p>While studying abroad in Australia, University of New South Wales runs on trimesters. After completing our January term class we were given 20 days to travel. With this amount of time, my friends and I decided to travel to Bali, Singapore and Thailand. </p>

          <div class="column" style="background-color:#aaa;">Bali<br>
            With advice from a local travel agent, we decided to stay in Seminyak, Bali for 7 nights, 8 days. While here we went to several locations within the area. Several days were spent at the various pool club locations including Miss Sippy and Mr. Potato Head. Another day included trips to several waterfalls including Air Terjun Waterfall, Tibumana Waterfall and the Tegenungan Waterfall. 
            In addition, we toured the Rice Terraces and the Monkey Sanutuary in Ubud. One of the last days included an all day tour to Nusa Penida, an island off of Bali. We enjoyed our trip to Bali and would go back! However, we would have stayed in Northern Bali and for a shorter amount of time!

          <div class="column" style="background-color:#bbb;">Singapore<br>
            From Bali, we took a quick plane over to Singapore for 2 days. Through Google and reccomendations we were able to give ourselves a self guided tour of the Raffles Hotel, Kampong Glam, Lau Pa Sat, Merloin PArk, Chinatown, Clarke Quay, Orchard Road and Little India. Every location was breathtaking and a must see. We spent our nights at Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay to experience the view from the top of the boat and a light show at Gardens by the Bay. If you find yourself traveling around Asia, Singapore is a must see.

          <div class="column" style="background-color:#ccc;">Thailand<br>
            Based on reccomendations, we decided to split our time in Thailand into two different cities. <br>
            <br>
            Phuket <br>
        
            Phuket is a beautiful beachy area in Thailand and very close to the Phi Phi Islands. We stayed in Phuket for 3 days. Here we spent one day with the elephants at the Elephant Jungle Sanctuary. The next day we took an overnight tour to the Phi Phi Islands. This is a must do in Phuket and I reccomend staying overnight at the Phi Phi Islands to get the ful experience.<br>

            Bangkok<br>
            <br>
            If you like the hustle and bustle of a city, Bangkok is worth seeing. Here we saw temples and palaces including the Grand Palace, the Temple of the Emerald Buddha and the Temple of the Golden Buddha. Another great thing to do here is the markets. Bangkok has many different markets, some are during the day and some are at night. We stopped at the Floating Markets and the Chatchak Weekend Markets
