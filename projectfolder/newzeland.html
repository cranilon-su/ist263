              When booking our trip to New Zealand we explored many options on flights and drives. We landed on flying into Christchurch and driving to Queenstown on the South Island. After flying to Christchurch, we rented a car and drove to Lake Tekapo where we camped overnight lake side. We stayed in a "glamping" style hostel and absolutely loved it. Sunrise the next day we drove the rest of the distance to Queenstown where we stayed at the Jucy Snooze. In New Zealand we did not waste time and sought out any adventure acitivites. We went skydiving, jet boating, ludging, hiking, white water rafting and more. We ended our nights bar hopping throughout the city! It was a must see in my abroad experience.  </div>
