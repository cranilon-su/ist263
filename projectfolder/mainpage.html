        <h2>Choosing my destination</h2>
        <p>When I first decided to study abroad, I thought to myself, where should I go? What would I like to see the most in the world. Immediately my mind landed on Australia and the surrounding locations. After applying to the abroad program at my school, I had to apply to the University of New South Wales abroad program. After being accepted for both programs, I began to plan my trip to New South Wales, Australia. 
                </p>
        <p> I lived in a suburb 15 minutes outside of downtown Sydney on the east coast of Australia. I rented an Airbnb with three friends from my University. </p>
